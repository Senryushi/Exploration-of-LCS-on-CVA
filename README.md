# Exploration-of-LCS-on-CVA

Welcome to Exploration of Lagrangian Coherent Structures on Crowd Video Analysis!
This is where you can find the code for all of the programs used in the making of my project.
We give a brief description of each python file:

FTLE.py - Calculates the FTLE field for a given analytical velocity field function
FTLE_CVA.py - Calculates the FTLE field for a given video file.
Farneback.py - Calculates the Optical flowfield using Farenback Optical Flow.
Perturbation_Direc.py - Calculate the Tangent Repulsion Rate, Normal Repulsion Rate and Repulsion Ratio for a given video
and output the result as a scalar field plot.
plotParticles.py - For a given analytical velocity field output a video of a Grid or Blob of particles being advected by that velocity field.
